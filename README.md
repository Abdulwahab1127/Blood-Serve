Blood-Serve addresses the critical need for efficient management of blood donation and transfusion processes in healthcare facilities. Ensuring access to safe and appropriate blood for patients is a priority in view of the growing demand for a blood donation system. However, the traditional manual methods of blood inventory management, donor screening, and transfusion coordination pose significant challenges, including human errors, inventory discrepancies, and delays in accessing life-saving blood. To overcome these challenges and optimize the blood supply chain, a comprehensive system is required to streamline donor screening, blood collection, inventory management, and transfusion processes while maintaining meticulous records of donor health histories and donation transactions. This Blood Bank Management System is developed to meet these needs, offering a robust platform for hospitals and blood banks to effectively manage their blood resources and improve patient care outcomes.(This is Just Semester Project)
